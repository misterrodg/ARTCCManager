# ARTCC Manager

ARTCC Manager is a web application to manage data and build files for VATSIM.
It is the result of my experience as an FE off and on since 2010.
I noticed that, as FEs come and go, an ARTCC may swing wildly from having
ever-current data with advanced maps, to rare updates with only basic data.
That experience is primarily dependent on the FE's familiarity with the various
data products, along with their own skillset to work with those products.
In order to narrow that skillset gap and allow for updates to be pushed even
during FE absences, I developed ARTCC Manager.

## Features

-   Manages ARTCC data:
    -   Imports FAA CIFP and NASR data
    -   Builds Airport, Runway, Nav data from NASR
    -   Builds SID/STAR/IAP data from CIFP as Diagrams/Vidmaps
    -   Builds M/P/R/W (Restrictive) Airspace from CIFP
-   Supports VRC, vSTARS and vERAM controller clients
-   Supports TWRTrainer as a training client

## Frontend

A limited frontend has been included to help people get started.
I'm more of a database/backend developer, so the UI and React code may be
sub-optimal. I appreciate your grace in this area.
Because of the variation in the auth implementations across ARTCCs,
the user/auth management is internal to this web application.

The functionality of ARTCC Manager will also be ported there.
